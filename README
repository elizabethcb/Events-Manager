This is the working copy of the transition to OOP and templating of Events Manager.

It has only been minimally tested.

For the most part it can work side by side with the previous version, but probably shouldn't be.

The RSVP, Calendar, People, and Widgets have not been transferred yet.

admin/pages contain the templates for the admin section
pages/ contain the templates for the front section

most of the css and js has been moved to appropriate files.

language functionality hasn't been tested.

This is a very awkward readme.  If you hadn't noticed.

Thanks,
Elizabeth
